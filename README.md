# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this challenge I needed to use jQuery and dayjs to complete. My most challenging part of this<br> 
challenge was learning to implement local storage, but<br>
by pushing past the struggle I have learnt a more in depth understanding of local storage which for<br> 
me was a huge leap forward! I am now much more confident in<br>
my abilities to use and implement local storage in future challenges and projects! Basically this<br> 
project now has color coded time blocks for each hour for when<br>
the normal work hour is past, present, or future. Also the current date is now in the header of<br> 
the website and the user can now type in which ever event they<br>
need to that is within normal business hours, and if they exit the page or refresh the page the<br> 
events are still shown in their work day scheduler. In order for the new events that the user<br>
wants to add to be saved, the user can use the save button to save the event to keep for<br> 
the future.
