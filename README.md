# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this challenge I needed to use jQuery and dayjs to complete. My most challenging part of this 
challenge was learning to implement local storage, but
by push past the struggle I have learnt a more in depth understanding of local storage which for 
me was a huge leap forward for me! I am now much more confident in
my abilities to use and implement local storage in future challenges and projects! Basically this 
project now has color coded time blocks for each hour for when
the normal work hour is past, present, or future. Also the current date is now in the header of 
the website and the user can now type in which ever event they
need to that is within normal business hours, and if they exit the page or refresh the page the 
events are still shown in their work day scheduler. In order for the new events that the user
wants to add to be saved the user can use the save button to save the event to keep for 
the future.
